## Goal
This tool is intended to help solving anagrams in games like 
[Le jardin des mots](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iscoolentertainment.snc&hl=fr).
It can test permutations of a given set of letters against a *mask* containing
optionally some already in-place letters.

It is even possible to limit the permutations to known French words. They are then
searched in `dict-fr-AU-DELA`, a French dictionary from 
Laboratoire d'Automatique Documentaire et Linguistique (LADL).

## Status

I currently use the program, yet I declare it to only by beta quality because
it is still lacking extensive tests.

## Installation

```console
pip install s-ball-anagram
```

## Usage

After installation, the program `anagram` should be directly accessible,
so typing:

```commandline
anagram
```

should be enough.

Alternately, it can be launched as a Python module with:

```commandline
python -m s_ball_anagram
```

The letters from which the anagrams are to be found can be typed in
uppercase or lowercase.

Then the mask to be searched should be provided by using `_` for unknown
letters. For example to search 4 letters anagrams the second of which is a
`A`, one should type `_a__` or `_A__`.
